the basic game should be a bare bones example with no extra features
i tried to make the code simple and readble, but its not perfect, feel free do improve/edit it

the fancy game should be a demo of many extra features that can be added

examples of extra features:
nps / talking / currency system
creatures / combat system
weight system for items
addional item functions (eating food, crafting, keys/locks, etc)
learnable spells or skills
puzzles or traps
